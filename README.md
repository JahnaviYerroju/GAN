Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with CIFAR-10 Dataset
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch and the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The code demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, and preparing data for training a GAN.

Key Features
Dataset: CIFAR-10, containing 10 classes of images

Libraries:
PyTorch
NumPy
scikit-learn
torchvision

The CIFAR-10 dataset includes the following classes:
Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck

Data Preprocessing
Uses transforms.Compose() to convert images to PyTorch tensors
Utilizes DataLoader for efficient batch processing
Supports both training and test datasets

How to Use
Clone the repository
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed
Run the Jupyter notebook to train and explore the GAN

Note: The code provides a foundational framework for understanding and implementing GANs with image data.
